## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers and our community in identifying potential issues. If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Send an email** to ja20gp@brocku.ca with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. **Use encryption** when possible. Our public PGP key is available on our website.
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested mitigation or fix if available

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- We aim to validate and respond to all reports within 5 business days.
- We will maintain communication with you about the progress of resolving the issue.
- After fixing the vulnerability, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
